# Dynatrace GitHub Action

[![Build Status](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/workflows/build-test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/actions)

This GitHub Action enables CI/CD workflows to report events and metrics to a Dynatrace monitoring environment.

## Usage

The action configuration must specify the Dynatrace `url` as well as an API `token` to be able to send information into a Dynatrace environment.
We strongly advise to use GitHub repository placeholders for both information here to prevent the exposure of secrets in your repository!

The `url` must contain a Dynatrace domain, e.g.: `https://{your-environment-id}.live.dynatrace.com`.

The `token` must contain a Dynatrace API v2 token with 'Ingest metrics' and/or 'Ingest events' scope enabled, as shown below:

Please note how `metrics` and `events` is configured as a string containing YAML code - this
allows to send more than one metric or event at once.
To send a metric, configure a job step like the following:

```yaml
- name: Build count
  uses: dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-github-action@v9
  with:
    url: '${{ secrets.DT_URL }}'
    token: '${{ secrets.DT_TOKEN }}'
    metrics: |
      - metric: "github.metric1"
        value: "1.0"
        dimensions:
          project: "${{ github.repository }}"
          branch: "${{ github.ref }}"
          event: "${{ github.event_name }}"
          owner: wolfgang
```

Analyze the resulting CI/CD pipeline metric within Dynatrace, as shown below:

You can also send Dynatrace events from workflows, same as `metric`. See below
how an event is configured within the `events` section.
The standard entity selector query is used to push the event on a selected entity or onto a
cohort of entities e.g.: a tagged set of services. See the Dynatrace [help page on entity selectors](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/shortlink/api-entities-v2-selector).
See some example entity selectors below:
- type(host),tag(prod) Selects all hosts with a tag 'prod'.
- type(service),entityName(login) Selects services with the name 'login'

For example, to send an event whenever a job has failed:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: build
    run: this-will-fail
  - name: Notify Dynatrace on Build Failed
    if: failure()
    uses: dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-github-action@v9
    with:
      url: '${{ secrets.DT_URL }}'
      token: '${{ secrets.DT_TOKEN }}'
      events: |
        - title: "Build failed"
          type: CUSTOM_INFO
          entitySelector: type(host),entityName(myHost)
          properties:
            description: "Branch ${{ github.ref }} failed to build"
            source: GitHub
            project: "${{ github.repository }}"
            branch: "${{ github.ref }}"
            event: "${{ github.event_name }}"
            owner: ${{ github.repository_owner }}
```

In another example, a deployment event can be sent onto a specific entity. In this example the event is sent to a mobile app whenever the Android GitHub Action build workflow succeeded:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: checkout
    uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: build
    run: this-will-fail
  - name: Notify Dynatrace on Build Failed
    if: failure()
    uses: dynatrace-oss/dynatrace-github-action@v9
    with:
      url: '${{ secrets.DT_URL }}'
      token: '${{ secrets.DT_TOKEN }}'
      events: |
        - type: CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT
          title: Mobile app version deployment failed
          entitySelector: type(MOBILE_APPLICATION),entityId(MOBILE_APPLICATION-C061BED4799B41C5)
          properties:
            source: GitHub
            deploymentName: "GitHub Action"
            deploymentVersion: "${{ github.ref }}"
            deploymentProject: "${{ github.repository }}"
            remediationAction: "None"
            ciBackLink: "https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}"
            project: "${{ github.repository }}"
            branch: "${{ github.ref }}"
            event: "${{ github.event_name }}"
            owner: wolfgang
```
